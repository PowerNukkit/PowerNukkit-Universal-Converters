dialog.about.description=This tool allows you to convert Minecraft worlds between different versions and editions, a great effort has been done to preserve the integrity and details of the world's content but this operation can be lossy depending on the conversion configurations and the source content.\n\nWorlds from modded Minecraft saves-games are partially supported, meaning that modded content may be replaced by something else or ignored.
